      <h1>Hi and welcome to my website!</h1>
      <h2>
        I am in my 5th year student at Northeastern University, set to graduate in July of 2021 with a BS in Computer Science.
        <br>
        &nbsp&nbspI started programming in high school for fun, and to stand a better chance at the Vex Robotics Competition.
        <br>
        &nbsp&nbspAfter entering college as a mechanical engineer, I realized I only looked forward to projects that involved programming. 
        <br>
        &nbsp&nbspI've only grown to love programming more as I learn more though classes and on my own.

        <br>
        <br>

        I am the acting president of Northeastern's 'No Jokes' Improv troupe.
        <br>
        &nbsp&nbspI was drawn to No Jokes because of the community they have built around having open improv jams for people to try improv without the pressure of performing.
        <br>
        &nbsp&nbspWe've been fortunate enough, during the pandemic, to have reduced capacity shows and online shows which can be found on our Youtube Channel.

        <br>
        <br>
        I'm also a huge fan of Tabletop Roleplaying games like Dungeons & Dragons. I love running games as much as I love playing through the worlds that friends have created.

        <h2>Read Speed Calculator</h2>
      </a>
      <p>A website for for determining how long it will take you to read an article given a link or pasted text. It also will calculate your reading speed for you if you don't already know it!</p>


      <a href="https://github.com/bgioggia/JokeBot" target="_blank">
        <h2>Discord Joke Bot</h2>
      </a>
      <p>I made a bot for my improv troupe's discord server. I've been missing seeing the members of our community outside of No Jokes events, so I made this bot to prompt jokes and bring a bit more activity to our server.</p>

        <h2>Boolean Network Grid</h2>
      </a>
      <p>A boolean network is a made up of a bunch of nodes that can either be on or off. They are interesting because they usually have an associated set of rules that will determine when nodes turn on or off over time. These are useful in biology for modeling gene regulatory networks, but they also just make really cool patterns. I made a grid where you can adjust the rules that turns each cell on or off.<br>Playing with this one can eat up more time than you realize so be careful and have fun!</p>

        <h2>Amazon Alexa Tic Tac Toe</h2>
      </a>
      <p>A skill for Amazon Alexa to keep track of your tic tac toe game in case you don't have any paper, but you do have your Amazon Echo. I made this because I thought the idea was funny, but there are still about 5-10 active users each week according to the dev console metrics. Whoever those 5-10 people are, I hope they're having fun!</p>

        <h2>Laser Pointer Shooting Gallery</h2>
      </a>
      <p>My freshman year at Northeastern University, I was lucky enough to be in a group of students that had the opportunity to make some games for an exhibition at the Boston Children's Museum. I programmed the Raspberry Pis used in the above shooting gallery to knock over the targets and keep score.</p>
